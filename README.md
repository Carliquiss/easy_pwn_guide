# Easy PWN Guide ⚠️ in progress ⚠️
_Binaries are from amstrongCTF and tamuCTF_

## Content 📚
In each folder inside this repository should be the following files: 

    * Binary: The binary compiled so you can run on your machine
    * Binary.c: If the source code is avaliable it will be on this file. 
    * solution.py: Python script which solves the challenge.
    * flag.txt: Most of the challenges print the content of a "flag.txt" file so you will need one.
    * README.md: Readme file with the explanation of how to resolve the challenge.
